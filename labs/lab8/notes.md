# Lab 8 Notes

- **No walking in the mazes!**  You will break the floor!

- It's probably a good idea to choose one maze and stick with it - different shadows in other mazes can impact your sensor readings.

- You can dead-reckon for the competition, not for functionality!  Functionality must use at least one sensor.
- Deadline for makeup assignment is L40.  Deadline for course critiques is BOC L39.

- There's the opportunity for bonus functionality in this lab!
  - You have to solve the maze from the A Door back to the entrance
  - The goal is to prevent you from hardcoding the maze into your program

- My recommendation: keep your algorithm simple!  That where, there's less to debug when things go wrong.
  - My robot uses a left wall following technique and this solves for all levels of functionality.

- The charge level of your battery can impact your sensor readings and motor speed - be wary of this!
