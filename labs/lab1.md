# Lab 1

In this lab, we'll introduce you to the development environment you'll be using for the remainder of the semester.  We'll also reinforce some of the concepts we've learned thus far.  By the end of the lab, you'll have programmed your MSP430 to light its onboard LEDs.

Notes:
- reinforce assembly / linking process
- reinforce all concepts taught to this point
    - addressing modes
    - instruction set
    - have them step through execution of their program
    - maybe even introduce them to the watchdog timer when adding code to disable - maybe as extra credit
