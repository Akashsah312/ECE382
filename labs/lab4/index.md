# Lab 4 - Polling and SPI in C

## Objectives

You've spent the last 5 lessons transitioning from programming in assembly language to C.  In this lab, you'll use C to satisfy the same requirements you did in Lab 3.  You'll be expected to write clean, maintainable, modular code that is committed regularly to Git.

## Details

### The Basic Idea

See Lab 3.

### Required Functionality

See Lab 3.

### B Functionality

You think your modules for working with delays, buttons, and the LCD could prove useful to other programmers.  You've decided to release them on Github as open source modules.

### A Functionality

Surfing around Github, you've noticed that high quality code comes complete with a robust unit test suite.  To ensure the quality of your modules, you've decided to add unit tests.

You can read more about testing here.

## Prelab

Paste the grading section in your lab notebook as the first page of this lab.

Include whatever information from this lab you think will be useful in creating your program.

## Notes

Read the [guidance on Labs / Lab Notebooks / Coding standards](/ECE382/notes/labs.html) thoroughly and follow it.
