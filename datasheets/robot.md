# Using the MSP430 with the Robot

## Powering the MSP430

Your MSP430 cannot take the 5V available on the robot or it will burn out!  You have to use a part called a **regulator** that will take 5V in and output 3.3V.  Mr. Evans has LDV33 regulators available - [see the datasheets page](/datasheets) for more information.
