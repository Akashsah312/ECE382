# L4 Assignment - Addressing Modes, Hand-assembly
## Addressing Modes

1. For each of the following instructions, identify the addressing modes being used and hand-assemble it.

2. Consider the following code snippet:
```
mov.w   #0xFF, P1OUT    ;P1OUT is 0x0021
```
What addressing modes are being used here?







Hand-assemble the code.







The programmer wants this code to move 0xFF into P1OUT, but the code isn't working.  Why not?  
*Hint: talk about the assembly / linking process.*

How would you change the code snippet to fix the problem?
