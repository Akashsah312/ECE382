Due Date: **Beginning of Class (BOC), Lesson 3**

**Authorized Resources**

This review is **individual effort** and willbe counted as a quiz grade.  You may seek help from any instructor and reference any publication in its completion.  You may **not** reference ECE382 skills reviews from previous years.  Normal documentation is required.

## Part 1: Software

Install the Code Composer Studio (CCS) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the instructions from [Computer Exercise 1](/ECE382/labs/compex1/index.html) - the "Installing Code Composer Studio (CCS)" block .  Do not do anything else from the computer exercise.

This will not be checked, but **it must be accomplished by BOC on Lesson 5**.  Failure to accomplish this will result in a **50% penalty** on this assignment.

## Part 2: Introduction to Numbering Systems

Objectives:


- Explain, by means of an example, the diea of positional weighting in numbering systems.
- Convert an arbitrary base Q number to a decimal number.
- Convert a decimal number to a number with base Q.


1. (5pts each) Convert the following numbers to decimal numbers.  **You must show your work for credit**.

    a. D209 (base 16)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    b. 40B7 (base 11)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    c. 672 (base 8)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    d. 10101110 (base 2)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. (5pts each) Convert the following numbers to the base(s) indicated.

    a. 547 (base 10) to base 2 and base 16
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    b. B36D (base 16) to base 2 and base 8
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
## Part 3: Representation of Negative Numbers

Objectives:


- Understand the concept of a sign bit.
- Understand the concept and uses of two's complement numbers.


3. (5pts each) Find the 8-bit two's complement representation of the following numbers.

    a. 116 (base 10)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    b. -37 (base 10)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    c. -2 (base 10)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. (5pts) What are the largest (most positive) and the smallest (most negative) 8-bit two's complement numbers in hexadecimal **and** decimal formats?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Part 4: Binary Addition and Subtraction, Concept of Overflow

Objectives:


- Explain the concept of overflow and when it occurs.
- Know how to add and subtract two binary numbers and note whether an overflow occurs.

5. (10pts each) All of the numbers below are represented using 8-bit, two's complement notation.  Perform the specified operations and specify whether or not an overflow occurs.

a.  
  1110 1101  
+ 1010 1100  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
b.  
  1001 1000  
- 1110 0111  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. (5pts) When an overflow occurs, a common solution is ot expand the number of bits used in the calculation (known as sign extension).  How would  you extend the negative 8-bit two's complement number with a hexadecimal value of BC to 16 bits?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7. (10pts each) Perform the specified operations and specify whether or not an overflow occurs.  Give the answer in unsigned 16-bit hexadecimal format.

a.  
  E76D (unsigned 16-bit)  
+   14 (2's comp 8-bit)  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
b.  
  BD72 (unsigned 16-bit)  
-   D6 (2's comp 8-bit)  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
## Part 5: Digital Logic

Objectives:


- Demonstrate the ability to design a digital logic circuit.

8. (5pts) Draw a schematic circuit that will generate the following equation.  You may use only the following gates: AND, OR, and NOT.  **No simplification is allowed**.

F = X'Y' + YZ' +X'Y'Z
