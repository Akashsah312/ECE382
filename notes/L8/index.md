## Directives

## Assembly Process

*[Discuss linking pre-compiled object files, etc]*

## Structured Design and Test

*[Emphasize modular design, design standards, etc]*

We're coming up on your first assignment that will require you to design / code a solution independently.  Even though it's a small project, we have to be disciplined in our approach.

For small projects, a structured approach to designing and testing your solution seems like overkill.  It seems like a lot of additional work with very little payoff.

But the larger your project becomes, the more difficult it is to fit the entire thing in your head simultaneously.

## Debugging

The additional work we put in up front will pay off in the event that we make a few mistakes - and we invariably do.
