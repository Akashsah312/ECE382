# How to Test Your Code

- *Huge* push in industry towards test driven development (TDD) and Unit Testing
    - For each new "feature" software, multiple test functions are written first
    - After writing the new function, the tests are *automatically* run during each build to verify correctness
    - Immediately notifies you if you "break" correctness with future modifications
- Functions should do only *one* thing
- Write test functions that cover all the conditions in your function
- Be sure to test normal and boundary conditions
