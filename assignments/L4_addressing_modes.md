# L4 Assignment 
## Addressing Modes

Consider the following code snippet:
```
mov.w   #0xFF, P1OUT
```
What addressing modes are being used here?

The programmer wants this code to move 0xFF into P1OUT, but the code isn't working.  Why not?  
*Hint: talk about the assembly / linking process.*

How would you change the code snippet to fix the problem?
