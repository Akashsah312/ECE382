Look into more interactive exercises.  Have cadets bring computers, MSP430 boards to class - actually do in-class coding.

Look into screen-sharing - remote desktop into cadet machines and show them writing code in front of rest of class.

Do more in-class exercises.  Maybe brief coding assignments in-class with me walking around.  Just get people into the practice of writing code.

Add note to logic analyzer about how to plug wires into the probes - lot of people screwing that up.  Also add note about aliasing.

Add videos of functioning labs.  Tough to explain what the lab should do - just show a video, that will get the message across much better.

Add more practical demos where possible - MSP430 interfacing with different types of hardware, doing different things, etc.

- Change Lab 5 game to memory game?
